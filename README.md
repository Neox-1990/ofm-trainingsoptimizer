# ofm-trainingsoptimizer
A little PHP skript / framework for calculating the best training for the german browsergame "Online Fu√üball Manager", working for Firefox and Chrome

The script includes also part that calculates the AWPs and got a calculator for the transfermarket.

The calculation is done with a simple per day optimization on TP for the hole team
The Input works by simple copy and paste, but is unstable with "unclean" copy and paste.

For train: copy the team in the train-view, but without the first checkbox

For transfermarket: copy the players you want the awp from, you can additional add EP+ and TP+ (for posible AWP with tournament and train-camps)

For AWP update: you have to update the AWP table (.txt) to keep the AWP-Calculation with the corresponding level correct. Do it manually or with the form. With the form just open the "AWP-Rechner" of OFM, then go to tab "Aufwertungsgrenzen" and there copy everything into the form (ctrl+a, ctrl+c, ctrl+v).

The Indexfile shows how to build up the setup for the calculation. It got some passwordprotection which you can change or disable if you like to.
